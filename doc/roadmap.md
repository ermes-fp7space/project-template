* Add basemap widget
* Add basemap layer support
* Set default map extent
* Add an operational layer from a MapService to the map

Other features (in no particular order):
 * Choose a [Dojo Dijit theme](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/intro_firstmap_amd.html)
 * use a single configuration file (it simulates user's profile data), Ch7
